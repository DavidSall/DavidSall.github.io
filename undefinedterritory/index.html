  <img width="70%" src="https://people.kth.se/~dsall/Images/Portfolio/undefinedterritory/textimage.jpg" alt="Bottendöd (the death of the seafloor), is a term almost collocal to the Baltic sea. The sea floor is almost completely dead, only inhabited, beside some few still persistent worms, by humans. The sea floor is littered with our stuff, critical communication, forgotten sunken ships, old bombs, dangerous chemicals, and trash that we just couldn’t find a better place for.
The Baltic sea floor is desolate, uninhabitable, a dead territory where no one lives. A product of a world that doesn’t see it. This is not an effort to revitalize it, or to save it. It’s an effort to explore the horrible, ugly, moist, and aversive created by negligence. The rug that has had all of societies dust swept under it. Let’s lift that rug.
The project explores the Baltic by the means we’re given, both “factual” and fantasy. It takes the map’s word for it. It shows the maps data as it’s said to be. A projection. The map is not a 3-dimensional map, it’s a physical projection of the 2-dimensional data, as the map states. The cables and pipelines follow the planar path as presented, projected on to the map. The CNC-mill negotiates with the wood, carves out the ocean like how the ice once carved it out. Bedrock, mud, and sand.
Bedrock, mud, and sand, 400 meters below the sea level, that’s what the sound is. Pressure, attenuation, pitch-shifting, and reverberation. Scraping along the sea floor. The scale of the map is 1:1 000 000, the depth is exaggerated by a factor of 100. To the south, half of Gotland, to the north, half of Åland.">
